## Simple Cinema Page
this is a simple cinema webpage project built with **HTML** and **CSS**, where users can view a list of cities and check the movies and their showtimes.

# Features:
- **City list**: displayed on the homepage, with city names highlighted in **green** and **clickable**.
- **Page navigation**: clicking on a city takes the user to a second page showing the movies currently playing and their schedules.
- **Visual highlight for movies**:
  - Movies playing **today** are shown in **red**.
  - Movies playing **tomorrow** are shown in **blue**.

the original version comes with a folder called "estados" to separate rj.html and sp.html into a single space, I left the files loose like this so that it could work well on github.
